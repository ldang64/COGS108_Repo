    "As college students, most of us are not unfamiliar with the idea of dating whether we’ve experienced it first-hand or seen it with our friends and family. However, dating, itself, is not a universally shared experience as different people have different attributes for what they look for in a significant other. Some attributes include attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Western culture, dating is usually seen as a period where “people engage in informal and often polygamous relationships” [1] where people try to find someone that they deem fit and compatible enough to settle down with. Nevertheless, every dating experience is different since there are many variables that come into play when it comes to dating. So, we wanted to look more into how personal qualities affect one’s desirability as a potential partner and how attraction comes into play when similar interests or traits are introduced to one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the studies conducted to test attraction are well-controlled experiments which raises the concern for a lack of ecological validity [3, 4]. However, Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar’s speed dating experiment combats that concern. Their speed-dating scenario provides experimental control yet also gives data on decisions made in a setting that mimics real world scenarios [1]. Therefore, we decided to use data from their experiment as we deemed it was the best fit experiment for our research question. From other previous speed-dating studies, there’s been a consistent finding in how the strongest predictor of attraction was physical attractiveness which is seen across both sexes [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "These research papers have led us to explore the idea of romantic attraction and how so many different variables come into play. Attraction is multi-dimensional and we want to study short-term and long-term to see if there’s a difference in attraction between people who are seeking ideal partners and people who aren’t necessarily looking to settle down yet. We believe that by exploring our research topic, we will have a better understanding of why certain dating preferences may exist. \n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that when it comes to meeting potential partners, desirability from the first impression stems from a person’s physical attractiveness and similar traits. We believe that physical attractiveness is the first thing partners look at because one of the principles of social psychology regarding initial attraction states that finding someone attractive is one of the first stages of wanting to develop a romantic relationship. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that similar traits would boost desirability."

In this experiment, participants at Columbia University were asked to sign up for various Speed Dating events taking place at bars and restaurants near campus.

Using this information, our group will be able to answer our research questions on whether certain qualities of a person and similarities increase the likelihood of finding a match. For this particular dataset, we will be reducing the amount of data points set out for us so that we can simplify the data and focus on traits of greater importance to our research. For instance, we can remove variables that include income, zip code, tuition, and etc. for variables that we want to delve into for our question and hypothesis such as race, career, activities, and field of study. \n",

Once participants are recruited and profiled by the Core Profile Survey, they are assigned one survey per week with a duration of 10 to 15 minutes. If responses were not made at the scheduled time, email reminders are sent out after three days.\n",

In order to address our research question on what qualities attract potential partners, we will be omitting data on household and marital status and focusing on traits sought for normally during first dates. These include racial background, education level, career, and religious and political preferences.\n"

    "Informed consent for the Speed Dating study was gathered when participants registered at an online website and filled out a pre-event survey. Participants were not permitted access to any other participants’ contact information prior to the start of the study and were only released if a matched pairing both accepted wanting to meet each other again. In this case, both sides of the pairing would have to express their consent to the team conducting the experiment. In terms of personally identifiable information such as name, email addresses, and school ID numbers, all remained anonymous throughout the experiment. In order to identify individual participants during the trials, each was given a name tag with a unique ID number. To ensure response anonymity, participants were given clipboards and scorecards with covers over them so that they could record their ratings in privacy.\n",
